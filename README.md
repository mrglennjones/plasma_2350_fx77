# plasma_2350_fx77
77 led strip effects for pimoroni plasma 2350 (reversed)

same as my version for the 2040 (https://github.com/mrglennjones/plasma_2040_fx77)  but with some added effects and reversed it so the pico end is at the top (for my stairs)

firework, bouncing ball and lava etc had been swapped around.


*Boot without BUTTON A held down = FX77
*Boot with BUTTON A held down = Starfield
*Tapping BUTTON A in Starfield = FX77
